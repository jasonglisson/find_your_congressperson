INTRODUCTION

Current Maintainer: Jason Glisson <jason.glisson@gmail.com>

This module allows users to lookup a congressman using a 5 digit US zipcode.
It connects to the Sunlight Foundation Congress API V3 
(https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress). The admin page allows you to
toggle on and off the features that you'd like to display. 



REQUIREMENTS
------------
No special requirements



INSTALLATION
------------
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.



CONFIGURATION
-------------
 * Configure user permissions in Administration » Configuration » Find Your Congressman:
 * Apply for a Sunlight Foundation API Key by going here: http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/accounts/register/
 * Configure the features that you'd like to display on the page. 
 
 
 
TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
 * If you are not getting results from the zipcode lookup:
   - Did you apply for an API key? Go here if you haven't: http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/accounts/register/
   - Did you activate the key? You should get an email with an activation link.
   - Did you insert the APi key into the config page?
